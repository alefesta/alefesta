I’m your next Senior Product Manager. 
Learn about me, about my skills and working experiences. Let me show you my personal projects and convince you I’m a great fit for your company.

*Highly energetic, charismatic leader with Technical proficiency as well as a Business attitude.*

Always Accountable, I’m the trusted partner for both engineering teams as well as the sales team. One who you may count to stand up in front of your prospect and customers
to convince them “We” are the right company to sign with or to present at a public event and showcase “Our” latest products.
A great Team-player, with the right expertise to start a product from scratch and deliver it on time as well as manage your existing portfolio during the entire lifecycle of
each product.
